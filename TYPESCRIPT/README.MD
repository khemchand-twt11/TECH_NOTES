# **TYPESCRIPT**

- Typescript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript(JavaScript with type annotations).
- It helps us write robust and maintanable code.
- It checks for error during development rather than at runtime which JavaScript does.
- Typescript iteself doesn't add any optimization
- Typescript code is transpiled to JavaScript, TypeScript code can't be run in the browser directly.
